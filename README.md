# InfoSec Situational Awareness Pack
Some good feeds for people who seriously want to keep up to date with InfoSec news and tech.

## Getting Started
1. Set up an account on an RSS reader of your choice (I suggest [feedly](https://feedly.com/)).
  1. Download and import [feeds.opml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonzeolla/infosec-situational-awareness-pack/master/feeds.opml) and read all the articles.
1. Setup a podcast app ([iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/), [Pocket Casts](https://play.pocketcasts.com/), etc.).
  1. Download and import [security_podcasts.opml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonzeolla/infosec-situational-awareness-pack/master/security_podcasts.opml)\*.  Set them all to automatically download (I suggest restricting this to only while on WiFi).
  1. If you want some good podcasts that sometimes touch on security, also import [it_podcasts.opml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonzeolla/infosec-situational-awareness-pack/master/it_podcasts.opml).  

\* Note:  There are significantly more InfoSec materials than this, but these are the ones I have found are most beneficial and are reasonable to keep up with.  For a more comprehensive list of materials, I suggest going down [this rabbit hole](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#security).
